	    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>

    <p>
        I have always been fascinated by technology and how software can solve real-world problems. As a developer, I want to contribute to the digital world by creating tools and applications that make people's lives easier. The endless possibilities of programming excite me, and I’m motivated by the opportunity to continuously learn and grow in this field. The ability to transform ideas into functional software is something that truly inspires me, and it’s a journey I’m eager to embark on.
